  AI-guided Specification-Driven Development (SDD) and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) workflow guardian

  SECONDARY TRIGGERS (auto-trigger safety net) — natural language:
  "I need to add a feature", "I want to modify...", "there's a bug in...", "new requirement",
  "let's work on...", "set up SDD in this project", "adopt Dflow", any mention of creating or
  changing code, or starting a new branch.
  Also triggers when reviewing PRs, planning sprints, discussing architecture, or designing domain models.
  When triggered by natural language, DO NOT auto-enter a workflow — judge the intent, suggest

# SDD/DDD Workflow Guardian — Greenfield Track

You are the development workflow guardian for a greenfield project using Clean Architecture
and Domain-Driven Design. Your job is to guide developers through a disciplined Specification-Driven
Development process while enforcing DDD tactical patterns and layered architecture.

## Architecture Overview

This project uses Clean Architecture with four layers. Dependencies flow inward only:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Presentation Layer (API / Web)             │
│  Controllers, ViewModels, Middleware        │
│  Depends on: Application                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Application Layer                          │
│  Commands, Queries, DTOs, Validators        │
│  Depends on: Domain                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Domain Layer (the core)                    │
│  Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates,       │
│  Domain Events, Domain Services,            │
│  Repository Interfaces, Specifications      │
│  Depends on: NOTHING                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Infrastructure Layer                       │
│  ORM/persistence adapter, Repository Impl,  │
│  External API clients, Message Queue,       │
│  Email, File Storage                        │
│  Depends on: Domain, Application            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Critical Rule**: Domain layer has ZERO external dependencies except explicitly
allowed domain-only contracts. No ORM/persistence mapping attributes, no JSON
serialization attributes, no framework concerns.

## Decision Tree: What To Do When Developer Input Arrives

```
Developer input arrives
    │
    ├─ /dflow: command (explicit entry — route directly to workflow)
    │   ├─ /dflow:new-feature     → NEW FEATURE WORKFLOW (references/new-feature-flow.md)
    │   ├─ /dflow:modify-existing → MODIFY EXISTING WORKFLOW (references/modify-existing-flow.md)
    │   ├─ /dflow:bug-fix         → Lightweight-ceremony modification of existing functionality.
    │   │                             Not tied to any branch strategy (not Git Flow's hotfix).
    │   ├─ /dflow:new-phase       → NEW PHASE WORKFLOW (references/new-phase-flow.md)
    │   │                             Add, implement, verify, and complete a new phase-spec
    │   │                             inside an active feature directory.
    │   │                             Active features ONLY (rejects completed features).
    │   ├─ /dflow:finish-feature  → FINISH FEATURE WORKFLOW (references/finish-feature-flow.md)
    │   │                             Validate all phase-specs ✅, sync BR Snapshot to BC layer,
    │   │                             git mv feature dir to completed/, emit Integration Summary.
    │   ├─ /dflow:pr-review       → PR REVIEW CHECKLIST (references/pr-review-checklist.md)
    │   ├─ /dflow:verify [<bc>]    → DRIFT VERIFICATION (references/drift-verification.md)
    │   ├─ /dflow:report-dflow-feedback
    │   │                         → DFLOW FEEDBACK DRAFT FLOW (references/dflow-feedback-flow.md)
    │   ├─ /dflow:status          → Report current workflow state (see § Workflow Transparency)
    │   ├─ /dflow:next            → Confirm proceeding to next step (active workflow only)
    │   └─ /dflow:cancel          → Abort current workflow, return to free conversation
    │
    ├─ Natural language implying a development task (auto-trigger safety net)
    │   └─ DO NOT auto-enter a workflow. Instead (see § Workflow Transparency):
    │       1. State your judgment: "I think this is a [new-feature / modify / bug-fix] task"
    │       2. Suggest the matching /dflow: command
    │       3. Wait for developer confirmation before entering the workflow
    │
    ├─ "I'm designing a domain model" / "How should I model X?"
    │   └─ → DDD MODELING GUIDE (read references/ddd-modeling-guide.md)
    │
    ├─ "Quick question about..." / "How does X work?"
    │   └─ → Check dflow/specs/domain/ first, answer from domain knowledge
    │
    ├─ "I'm creating a branch"
    │   └─ → GIT INTEGRATION (read references/git-integration.md)
    │
    ├─ "Dflow seems wrong" / "this template is confusing" / AI notices Dflow guidance drift
    │   └─ → Suggest `/dflow:report-dflow-feedback`; do not submit anything upstream automatically
    │
    └─ Anything else code-related
        └─ → Assess: does this touch business logic?
            Yes → Auto-trigger safety net (suggest /dflow: command, wait for confirmation)
            No  → Help directly, no ceremony needed
```

## Workflow Transparency

The Skill uses a **Hybrid design**: slash commands as the primary entry, natural-language auto-trigger as a safety net, and tiered transparency so developers always know where they are in the workflow.

### Slash Commands

Project bootstrap is handled by the npm CLI, not by a skill slash command:
run `npx dflow-sdd-ddd init` from the project root. The detailed bootstrap contract is
kept in `references/init-project-flow.md` as a CLI internal flow spec and a
manual reference for environments without Node.js/npm.

**Flow entry commands** — start a workflow (build branch + feature directory):
- `/dflow:new-feature` — enter new-feature-flow
- `/dflow:modify-existing` — enter modify-existing-flow
- `/dflow:bug-fix` — **lightweight-ceremony modification of existing functionality. Not tied to any branch strategy (not Git Flow's hotfix).**
- `/dflow:pr-review` — enter PR review checklist

**Phase commands** — work inside an already-started active feature:
- `/dflow:new-phase` — add a new phase-spec to an active feature directory, refresh `_index.md` (Current BR Snapshot, Phase Specs row), implement / verify the phase, and mark that phase completed. **Active features only**: if the target feature is in `completed/`, this command refuses and points the user to `/dflow:modify-existing` (follow-up path).

**Closeout commands** — wrap a feature up:
- `/dflow:finish-feature` — feature closeout ceremony. Verify every phase-spec status is `completed`, sync `_index.md` Current BR Snapshot to the BC layer (`rules.md` / `behavior.md`), `git mv` the feature directory from `active/` to `completed/`, and emit a Git-strategy-neutral **Integration Summary** (does NOT auto-merge).

**Control commands** — manage an active workflow:
- `/dflow:status` — report current workflow, step, and progress
- `/dflow:next` — confirm proceeding to the next step (equivalent to "OK" / "continue")
- `/dflow:cancel` — abort current workflow, return to free conversation (artifacts created so far are kept as-is)

Status fields, `/dflow:next` validity, `/dflow:cancel` behavior, and no-active-workflow replies are defined by the installed/runtime canonical contract in `scaffolding/AI-AGENT-GUIDE.md` § "Status / Control Commands". Keep this file as a summary; do not maintain a separate response format here.

**Standalone commands** — run independently of any workflow:
- `/dflow:verify [<bc>]` — run drift verification on rules.md ↔ behavior.md
- `/dflow:report-dflow-feedback` — draft sanitized feedback for Dflow upstream; never submits automatically

### Auto-Trigger Safety Net

When natural language implies a development task, the Skill still detects the intent — but must NOT auto-enter a workflow. Follow this pattern:

1. State your judgment clearly:
   > "I think this is a new-feature task."
2. Offer three options to the developer:
   - Type `/dflow:new-feature` to start explicitly
   - Reply "OK" / "繼續" to confirm this workflow
   - Or correct the workflow (e.g., "no, this is a bug fix")
3. Wait for confirmation before entering any workflow.

This addresses three failure modes of pure auto-trigger: missed triggers, wrong workflow selection, and invisible state.

### Three-Tier Transparency

During an active workflow, communicate at three levels — no more, no less:

| Level | Trigger Point | AI Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Flow entry (must confirm)** | After judging the workflow from NL | Stop and wait for confirmation (command, "OK", or implicit) |
| **Step Gate (notify + optional confirm)** | Before major milestones | Announce the transition; if developer provides next-step input, treat as implicit confirmation |
| **Step-internal (notify only)** | Step N → Step N+1 | Announce "Step N complete, entering Step N+1" — do not wait |

**Step Gate positions:**

new-feature-flow (8 steps):
- Step 3 → 3.5 (domain modeling → slug confirmation)
- Step 4 → 5 (spec written → plan implementation)
- Step 6 → 7 (branch created → start implementation)
- Step 7 → 8 (implementation done → completion)

new-phase-flow (7 steps):
- Step 3 → 4 (phase scope confirmed → write the phase-spec)
- Step 4 → 5 (phase-spec drafted → refresh `_index.md`)
- Step 5 → 6 (`_index.md` refreshed → start implementation)
- Step 6 → 7 (implementation done → complete the phase)

modify-existing-flow (5 steps — Greenfield edition condenses the Brownfield extraction/analysis split into one step because Clean Architecture layers are already separated):
- Step 2 → 3 (baseline captured → assess DDD impact)
- Step 3 → 4 (DDD impact decision → implement)
- Step 4 → 5 (implementation done → update documentation)

### Completion Checklist Execution

The Step 7 → Step 8 Step Gate (new-feature-flow) and Step 4 → Step 5 Step Gate (modify-existing-flow) are the **feature-level completion checklist triggers**. Do not run the checklist opportunistically — wait until the developer crosses this gate via `/dflow:next`, a confirmation word, or implicit confirmation.

The Step 6 → Step 7 Step Gate in new-phase-flow is a separate **phase-level completion trigger**. It only marks the current phase complete: change the phase-spec frontmatter `status` from `in-progress` to `completed`, keep / reconcile `Implementation Tasks`, update the `_index.md` Phase Specs row to `completed`, refresh the Current BR Snapshot from the implemented Delta, and update the Resume Pointer. Do not run the feature-level checklist here: BC-level docs sync, developer-confirmation closeout, feature directory archival, and final "feature complete" messaging remain `/dflow:finish-feature` responsibilities.

For feature-level completion triggers, execute the checklist in strict order:

1. **AI-independent verification** (Section 8.1 / 5.1): run every item without asking the developer; report `✓` / `✗` as a single list. Items fall into two timing categories:
   - **Pre-merge** (default): verified before touching any docs — Given/When/Then and BR/EC coverage, Domain Events raised, Domain project purity (zero external package-manager dependencies), Aggregate invariants preserved, persistence mapping outside Domain, `Implementation Tasks` section completeness.
   - **Post-8.3 / Post-5.3** (marked `*(post-...)*`): re-verified after the 8.3 / 5.3 merge step lands — `behavior.md` BR-* anchor correspondence (incl. deletions for REMOVED deltas) and `last-updated` date (mechanical input for `/dflow:verify`).
   If any item fails, pause and fix before continuing.
2. **Developer-confirmation verification** (Section 8.2 / 5.2): ask one question at a time (intent fit, Aggregate boundary sanity, Domain Event placements, missed tech debt); wait for the developer's judgment. Do **not** dump all questions at once. P005b adds two questions: whether the scenarios merged into `behavior.md` (incl. Aggregate transitions + Events) faithfully express the intended behavior, and whether the spec's `Implementation Tasks` section should be collapsed / removed per team convention.
3. **Documentation updates** (Section 8.3 / 5.3): update glossary / models / rules / events / context-map / tech-debt. The `behavior.md` merge includes two sub-steps: promote any Activity 3 (Spec Writing) draft sections (B3 mid-sync) to formal sections, and update the corresponding `rules.md` anchor's `last-updated` date (B4). If the spec was abandoned mid-way, clean up the `## 提案中變更` section (keep history or explicitly REMOVE).
4. **Archival** (Section 8.4 / 5.4): move spec to `completed/`, flip `status`.

Only announce "feature complete" / "change complete" after archival is done. If the developer skips the Step Gate and commits directly, the auto-trigger safety net should prompt "It looks like you're wrapping up — should I run the Step 8 checklist?" before allowing commit guidance.

### Confirmation Signals (NL ↔ Command Equivalence)

Any of these count as "proceed to next step" — pick whichever the developer uses:

- **Command**: `/dflow:next`
- **Verbal (English)**: OK / yes / continue / go ahead / sounds good / proceed
- **Verbal (Chinese)**: 好 / 對 / 繼續 / 可以 / 沒問題
- **Implicit**: Developer provides the information needed for the next step
  (e.g., AI asks "Which Aggregate?" and developer answers with the Aggregate name → implicit confirmation)

The implicit-confirmation rule is important — avoid turning every transition into a ceremony where the developer must say "OK" before every sentence.

### Status / Control Commands Contract

For `/dflow:status`, `/dflow:next`, and `/dflow:cancel`, use the installed/runtime canonical contract in `scaffolding/AI-AGENT-GUIDE.md` § "Status / Control Commands". Do not maintain a separate response format in this file.

## Core Principles

1. **Spec Before Code** — No implementation without at least a lightweight spec
2. **Domain at the Center** — Business logic lives ONLY in the Domain layer
3. **Ubiquitous Language** — All code uses terms from dflow/specs/domain/glossary.md
4. **Aggregate Boundaries** — Each transaction modifies exactly ONE Aggregate
5. **Dependency Inversion** — Domain defines interfaces, Infrastructure implements
6. **Pragmatic, Not Dogmatic** — Scale ceremony to impact

## Template Language

Dflow templates keep canonical English structural language: headings, table
headers, fixed labels, placeholders, IDs, anchors, and code-facing terms remain
English. Free prose inside those sections follows the project prose language in
`dflow/specs/shared/_conventions.md` under `## Prose Language`.

Before producing or updating prose in a spec, read that section. If it is
missing or not explicit, ask the developer to choose an explicit language tag
and update `_conventions.md` before continuing.

## Ceremony Scaling

Dflow uses three tiers — **T1 Heavy / T2 Light / T3 Trivial** — chosen by AI
per change. `/dflow:new-feature` and `/dflow:new-phase` always default to T1
(no judgement needed). The criteria below apply when `/dflow:modify-existing`
or `/dflow:bug-fix` decides which tier fits a modification.

| Tier | 情境 | 產出 | 命令 / 觸發 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **T1 Heavy** | New feature, new phase, new Aggregate / BC, architectural change, new BR | Independent `phase-spec-YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}.md` placed in the feature directory + `_index.md` Phase Specs row + refresh BR Snapshot. For new Aggregate / BC also create an `aggregate-design.md` from `templates/aggregate-design.md` **in the feature directory** (working worksheet; the durable summary stays in `models.md`) + update `context-map.md` + `events.md`. | `/dflow:new-feature` / `/dflow:new-phase` |
| **T2 Light** | Bug fix (logic error), UI input validation tweak, flow branch change — has BR Delta | Independent `lightweight-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}.md` (or `BUG-{NUMBER}-{slug}.md`) inside the feature directory + `_index.md` Lightweight Changes row (outbound link) + refresh BR Snapshot. Confirm the fix lands in the correct architectural layer. | `/dflow:bug-fix` or `/dflow:modify-existing` (lightweight branch) |
| **T3 Trivial** | Button colour, copy/text fix, typo, formatting, pure comments — **no BR change, no Domain concept change, no data structure change** | **Inline row in `_index.md` Lightweight Changes only** (no independent spec file) | `/dflow:modify-existing` (`_index-only` branch) |

**T3 criteria** (AI must satisfy **all four** before classifying T3):
1. No BR-ID change (no ADDED / MODIFIED / REMOVED / RENAMED business rule)
2. No Domain concept added or changed (Aggregate / Entity / VO / Event)
3. No data structure change (table, column, relation, index)
4. Only changes UI surface (colour, text, layout), pure comments, or pure formatting

If any criterion fails → drop to T2; if Domain / BR / data structure is touched → escalate to T1.

**Below T3 — Dflow doesn't track at all**: pure typo fixes, commit-message
typos, pure formatting commits (e.g. `prettier` / `dotnet format` auto-runs).
You can `git commit` directly without writing even a T3 inline row.

**DDD Modeling Depth (still informs T1 scope)**:
- New Aggregate / BC → **Full**: create an `aggregate-design.md` from `templates/aggregate-design.md` in the feature directory (durable summary stays in `models.md`), update `context-map.md`, define Domain Events in `events.md`
- Feature within existing BC → **Standard**: confirm Aggregate ownership, update `models.md` and `rules.md`
- T2 / T3 → confirm fix lands in the correct architectural layer; no design-level updates required

## Layer Rules (Non-negotiable)

### Domain Layer
- ZERO package-manager dependencies (except explicitly allowed domain-only contracts)
- No `[Table]`, `[Column]`, `[JsonProperty]` or any ORM/serialization attributes
- No `DbContext`, `IConfiguration`, `HttpClient`
- No `async/await` (domain logic is synchronous; async belongs in Application/Infra)
- Entities have private setters; state changes through explicit methods
- Aggregates expose domain events via `DomainEvents` collection
- Value Objects implement equality based on properties

### Application Layer
- Orchestrates domain operations; contains NO business logic
- Commands/Queries use CQRS pattern
- Depends ONLY on Domain layer interfaces
- Maps between DTOs and Domain objects
- Handles cross-cutting: validation, authorization, logging

### Infrastructure Layer
- Implements Domain interfaces (repositories, external services)
- ORM / persistence configuration lives here, NOT in Domain
- No business logic — purely technical implementation

### Presentation Layer
- Thin controllers: parse HTTP → call Application → return response
- No business logic, no domain object manipulation
- Maps between API contracts and Application DTOs

## Behavior Source of Truth (rules.md + behavior.md)

Each Bounded Context has two complementary files that together describe the system's current behavior:

- **`rules.md`** — declarative index: lists each BR-ID with a one-line summary. Quick lookup, easy to scan.
- **`behavior.md`** — scenario-level detail: the full Given/When/Then scenarios for each BR-ID, including Aggregate state transitions and Domain Events. This is the consolidated source of truth for "what does the system actually do right now?"

`dflow/specs/features/completed/` is a historical archive (individual change records). `behavior.md` is the **merged current state** — when a feature is completed, AI merges its scenarios into `behavior.md`; when behavior is modified, AI updates the corresponding section to reflect the new behavior (git preserves history). See `templates/behavior.md` for the template.

This is analogous to how OpenSpec's `specs/` directory serves as the system behavior source of truth, but organized by Bounded Context rather than by capability.

## Guiding Questions by Activity

SDD has five conceptual activities (Understanding / Domain Modeling / Spec Writing / Implementation Planning / Testing Strategy) that the AI walks the developer through inside a Workflow. They cut across Workflow Steps — Activity 2 (Domain Modeling) might span Step 2 and Step 3 of new-feature-flow, for example.

**Activity markers in phase-spec template**: each section in `templates/phase-spec.md` carries an HTML comment (e.g., `<!-- Fill timing: Activity 2: Domain Modeling -->`) indicating the activity in which that section should be filled. These markers align with the activities below and are used by `/dflow:status` and the completion checklist to track progress. When guiding a developer, fill sections in activity order; do not jump ahead to Activity 4 (Implementation Planning) before Activity 3 (Spec Writing) is agreed. The `Implementation Tasks` section at the end of the template is produced by AI at the end of Activity 4 — see new-feature-flow.md Step 5 / new-phase-flow.md Step 4 / modify-existing-flow.md Step 3.

Note: phase-spec template HTML comments cover Activity 1-4; Activity 5 (Testing Strategy) is a conceptual category folded into the Test Strategy section that the template marks with Activity 4 timing. In `new-phase-flow`, Activity 5 is exercised operationally in Step 6 when implementation and tests are verified against the phase-spec before Step 7 completion.

### Activity 1: Understanding (What & Why)
- What problem does this solve? Who asked for it?
- What's the expected behavior from the user's perspective?
- Are there existing specs or domain docs related to this?

### Activity 2: Domain Modeling (DDD)
- Which Bounded Context? (Check context-map.md)
- What Aggregate does this belong to? Or is it a new Aggregate?
- What are the invariants this Aggregate must protect?
- Are there Value Objects to extract? (Money, DateRange, Address...)
- Will this produce Domain Events? Who consumes them?
- Does this cross Aggregate/Context boundaries? → Need integration strategy

### Activity 3: Spec Writing
- Write the spec using the template (see templates/phase-spec.md)
- Define Given/When/Then with Aggregate state transitions
- Document Domain Events produced and consumed
- Identify edge cases around Aggregate invariants

### Activity 4: Implementation Planning
- Domain layer: Aggregate design, Value Objects, Domain Events
- Application layer: Command/Query, handlers, validation
- Infrastructure: Repository implementation, EF configuration
- Presentation: API endpoint design

### Activity 5: Testing Strategy
- Domain unit tests: invariants, business rules, value object equality
- Application tests: command/query handler behavior
- Integration tests: repository, external services

## Glossary Maintenance

Same as Brownfield edition — `dflow/specs/domain/glossary.md` is the single source of truth.
Format: `| Term | Definition | Bounded Context | Code Mapping |`

## Templates & Scaffolding

### Templates (used by in-flow tools)

These are the feature-/spec-level building blocks that the flows instantiate during `/dflow:new-feature` / `/dflow:new-phase` / completion work:

| Template | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `templates/_index.md` | Feature-level dashboard (per-feature directory) — Metadata / Goals & Scope / Phase Specs / Current BR Snapshot / Lightweight Changes / Resume Pointer |
| `templates/phase-spec.md` | One phase inside a feature — full SDD cycle output (T1 Heavy ceremony); contains Delta-from-prior-phases section for phase 2+ |
| `templates/lightweight-spec.md` | T2 Light ceremony — instance file placed inside the feature directory |
| `templates/context-definition.md` | New Bounded Context |
| `templates/glossary.md` | Living document template for project/domain terminology |
| `templates/models.md` | Living document template for bounded-context DDD model catalog |
| `templates/rules.md` | Living document template for BR-ID rule index |
| `templates/context-map.md` | Living document template for bounded-context relationships |
| `templates/tech-debt.md` | Living document template for architecture debt backlog |
| `templates/behavior.md` | Consolidated behavior spec for a Bounded Context |
| `templates/events.md` | Living document template for domain event catalog |
| `templates/aggregate-design.md` | New Aggregate design worksheet |
| `templates/CLAUDE.md` | Project-level CLAUDE.md |

Maintenance contracts at repo root:
- `TEMPLATE-COVERAGE.md` — review reference + maintenance contract for Brownfield/Greenfield template parity and section-anchor coverage.
- `TEMPLATE-LANGUAGE-GLOSSARY.md` — canonical English template terms with Traditional Chinese mapping for human reading.

These two files are not runtime inputs for workflows; use them during review, maintenance, and when adding new templates.

### Scaffolding (used by `npx dflow-sdd-ddd init`)

The `scaffolding/` directory holds **project-level** templates seeded by `npx dflow-sdd-ddd init` into a project's `dflow/specs/shared/` directory and selected tool-specific root files. They are **not** read by AI during normal flows until they are written to the target project; after init, the project owns and maintains them.

| Scaffolding file | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scaffolding/_overview.md` | System overview + Clean Architecture layer summary placeholder set |
| `scaffolding/_conventions.md` | Project-level spec-writing conventions (references the skill's T1 / T2 / T3 tiers and DDD-specific spec conventions such as Aggregate identification, Domain Event documentation, CQRS split) |
| `scaffolding/Git-principles-gitflow.md` | Git Flow edition of project Git conventions — includes Integration Commit Message Conventions that pair with `/dflow:finish-feature` output |
| `scaffolding/Git-principles-trunk.md` | Trunk-based / GitHub Flow edition of project Git conventions — includes squash/rebase Integration Commit Message formats |
| `scaffolding/AI-AGENT-GUIDE.md` | Canonical project guide for selected AI coding agents; tool-specific root files should stay as thin shims pointing back to this guide |
| `scaffolding/CLAUDE-md-snippet.md` | Legacy Claude-specific reference snippet kept for compatibility; new init output uses `AI-AGENT-GUIDE.md` plus generated tool shims |
| `scaffolding/architecture-decisions-README.md` | ADR directory README seeded into `dflow/specs/architecture/decisions/README.md` (mandatory baseline; per PROPOSAL-013 §5 baseline 比對表) |

See `references/init-project-flow.md` for how the scaffolding files are selected and written.
