# Dflow AI Agent Guide

This project uses Dflow for spec-first AI-assisted development.

## Project Context

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Project | {System Name} |
| Dflow track | {edition} |
| Project type | {project-type} |
| Tech stack | {tech-stack-summary} |
| Migration / legacy context | {migration-context} |
| Prose language | {prose-language} |

## Before Editing Code

Do not jump from a request directly to code. First identify the matching
Dflow workflow and confirm the intended path with the developer.

Use these workflow entry points as plain chat instructions if slash commands
are not available in the current AI tool:

| Workflow | Use when |
|---|---|
| `/dflow:new-feature` | A new user-visible capability or business behavior is requested. |
| `/dflow:modify-existing` | Existing behavior needs to change. |
| `/dflow:bug-fix` | A defect can be described with expected vs actual behavior. |
| `/dflow:new-phase` | An active feature needs another implementation slice. |
| `/dflow:finish-feature` | Implementation is complete and needs drift closure. |
| `/dflow:verify` | Specs, domain docs, implementation, and tests need consistency checks. |
| `/dflow:pr-review` | A change is ready for SDD/DDD review. |

## Source of Truth

Dflow-owned project documents live under `dflow/specs/`.

| Area | Path |
|---|---|
| Shared conventions | `dflow/specs/shared/_conventions.md` |
| System overview | `dflow/specs/shared/_overview.md` |
| Domain glossary | `dflow/specs/domain/glossary.md` |
| Context map | `dflow/specs/domain/context-map.md` |
| Active feature specs | `dflow/specs/features/active/` |
| Completed feature snapshots | `dflow/specs/features/completed/` |
| Technical debt | `dflow/specs/architecture/tech-debt.md` or `dflow/specs/migration/tech-debt.md` |

## Core Rules

1. Spec before code: meaningful behavior changes need a spec or lightweight bug spec before implementation.
2. Keep domain language explicit: update glossary, rules, models, and behavior snapshots when domain meaning changes.
3. Keep phase delta, feature snapshot, and system state separate.
4. Check drift before calling work complete.
5. Follow `dflow/specs/shared/_conventions.md`, especially `## Prose Language`.

## Tool-Specific Notes

This file is the canonical Dflow guide. Root-level files such as
`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
should stay thin and point back here.

If a tool does not support Dflow slash commands, treat the command names as
plain workflow names and execute the matching process from the Dflow skill
source in this repository.
